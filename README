python3 -m venv teamMKV_env
source teamMKV_env/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 script.py

This will generate a file called teamMKV_movies_with_score.json
It will take a long time the first time it is run, and then only look for new movies the other time
